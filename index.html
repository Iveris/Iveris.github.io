                    Whether you want to audition for a conservatory, or just learn to play songs around the campfire, I
                    can help you get there and have fun in the process. I have helped many children and adults alike
                    learn to play music that motivates and inspires them. Whatever your goals, we can work together to
                    help you achieve them.
                    <br> <br>
                    Learn the problem solving skills that professionals use to learn and perform music. While there are
                    no shortcuts to mastering an instrument, you can save a lot of time by learning effective practice
                    habits from the beginning.
                    <br> <br>
                    If your interest is in classical music, then we can explore the rich history of the
                    instrument, and learn how to adjust to the stylistic considerations of each era.
                    I have been very fortunate to study with many fantastic classical guitarists, and I want to share
                    all that I know.

                    Teaching kids is a lot of fun! It's an opportunity for a child to learn through play and
                    build self-esteem through earned improvement. Plus, they get REALLY excited!
                    <br><br>
                    Learning guitar can also be a great way for parents to spend time with their children.
                    Especially for students ages 5-9, parental involvement can make a huge impact.
                    Even spending 10 minutes a day helping your child practice can lead to incredible results! But more
                    importantly, it's a fun activity that you can do together.
                    <br><br>
                    It's quality time with you child that helps them learn to focus, to work towards a goal, and to
                    experience how work leads to improvement. My teaching involves working with children AND their
                    parents to facilitate quality practice time at home.

                <p> <br>
                    Warner Iveris performs regularly on the classical guitar, baroque guitar, and theorbo.
                    <br><br>
                    As an accompanist, he has performed in many chamber and operatic programs including a production of
                    Handel's Alcina at the Glenn Gould School in
                    Toronto under director Ivars Taurins, and a production of Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas at the Juilliard
                    School where he served as a guest artist.
                    <br><br>
                    As a soloist, Dr. Iveris has performed in the Rochester
                    Early Music Festival, Pegasus Rising concert series, and Lute Society of America Festival. During
                    his studies at the Eastman School of Music, Dr. Iveris co-directed a production of John Blow’s Venus
                    and Adonis, which was the very first staged production in Eastman’s Hatch Hall.
                    <br><br>
                    Recently, Dr. Iveris
                    worked in close collaboration with Berlin-based composer Ruth Wiesenfeld to develop and then perform
                    “nun ist aber der einzelne Ton beziehungslos”, a piece for solo theorbo.

                <h2>Teaching</h2>
                <p> <br>
                    An avid educator, Warner Iveris has given lectures at various colleges (including DePauw University,
                    the University of Rochester, Rochester Institute of Technology, and the Eastman School of Music
                    among others) and has taught guitar history at the Eastman School of Music.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition, he teaches private lessons to students ranging from five year olds to students in
                    college and even retirees. He teaches in both classical and non-classical musical styles, basing
                    lessons on each student's long-term goals.
                    <br><br>
                    In his role as a teacher, Dr. Iveris creates a highly structured and
                    organized environment that focuses on achieving excellence in performance while maintaining a
                    positive atmosphere that celebrates individual success.
                    <br><br>
                    He is proud to work for the Hochstein School where anyone can receive quality musical instruction
                    regardless of their ability or their socio-economic status. Everyone deserves a chance to learn.
