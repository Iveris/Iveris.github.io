                    Whether you want to audition for a conservatory, or just learn to play songs around the campfire, I
                    can help you get there and have fun in the process. I have helped many children and adults alike
                    learn to play music that motivates and inspires them. Whatever your goals, we can work together to
                    help you achieve them.
                    <br> <br>
                    Learn the problem solving skills that professionals use to learn and perform music. While there are
                    no shortcuts to mastering an instrument, you can save a lot of time by learning effective practice
                    habits from the beginning.
                    <br> <br>
                    If your interest is in classical music, then we can explore the rich history of the
                    instrument, and learn how to adjust to the stylistic considerations of each era.
                    I have been very fortunate to study with many fantastic classical guitarists, and I want to share
                    all that I know.
                    <br><br>

                    Teaching kids is a lot of fun! It's an opportunity for a child to learn through play and
                    build self-esteem through earned improvement. Plus, they get REALLY excited!
                    <br><br>
                    Learning guitar can also be a great way for parents to spend time with their children.
                    Especially for students ages 5-9, parental involvement can make a huge impact.
                    Even spending 10 minutes a day helping your child practice can lead to incredible results! But more
                    importantly, it's a fun activity that you can do together.
                    <br><br>
                    It's quality time with you child that helps them learn to focus, to work towards a goal, and to
                    experience how work leads to improvement. My teaching involves working with children AND their
                    parents to facilitate quality practice time at home.

                <h2>Student Testimonials</h2>
                <p>
                    “I began classical guitar study as an older adult, continuing with Warner in weekly lessons for the
                    past two years. His precise approach and knowledge of the history and repertoire of the instrument
                    have enabled me to progress way beyond my expectations. His demonstrations, exercises, and
                    step-by-step assignments to explore moveable scales on the fretboard have helped me overcome
                    technical challenges, further develop musical expression, and improve left- hand execution in
                    performing studies and pieces. Throughout he has chosen appealing, motivating selections, and has
                    been unfailingly kind and good humored.”
                    -Joan
                    <br><br><br>
                    "Warner has an easygoing, engaging teaching style for students of all ages. As someone who didn't
                    start lessons until later in life, I appreciate the patience with my busy work schedule and a chance
                    to start totally fresh in the world of music!"
                    - Maggie
                    <br><br><br>
                    "Unfailingly patient, kind, and open to a range of musical genres, we're grateful that Warner was
                    our daughter's guitar teacher for the past two years. He responded to her uneven approach to
                    practicing with supportive good humor, and he was a positive and stable presence during the
                    disruptions of this past year."
                    - Rebecca
                    <br><br><br>
                    "Our family had a wonderful experience with Dr. Iveris. My 7 year old son took both individual and
                    group guitar lessons with him and was always excited to go to his lessons. Dr. Iveris was
                    enthusiastic about parents staying for the lessons so they could help their children practice at
                    home. He was organized, had goals and objectives for our son, and always ready to keep our young
                    learner focused on the lesson. I believe Dr. Iveris was genuinely interested in seeing our child
                    make progress in guitar, and I could see that my son was just so happy during his lessons!” -The
                    Mathews Family

                    “Warner is an amazing musician and an excellent guitar teacher. My son Corwin started taking lessons
                    from him when he just turned five. Warner was very patient with him and was able to keep him focused
                    and interested. When the pandemic hit and we were forced to retreat to virtual lessons, not only was
                    he able to transition to teaching virtually seamlessly with various technologies, but he was also
                    innovative with how to keep students engaged remotely. Corwin looked forward to playing their
                    “role-playing music game” every week and would practice his “battle songs” so he could win battles
                    in the game. Corwin was so inspired by Warner, he decided that he wants to be a musician and
                    conductor when he grows up.
                    <br><br>
                    Corwin’s progress in guitar triggered my interests in guitar. I also started taking lessons from
                    Warner. I truly enjoyed our lessons. On the technical side, Warner was able to pin point my trouble
                    spots and help me overcome those obstacles quickly. Many times, with just a little hint of how to
                    position my hand or a certain finger practice during the lesson, I was able to do what I was not
                    able to achieve with a week of practice. On the musical side, after we tackled the technical issues,
                    Warner would discuss the phrases of the music, how to make the music sound interesting and engaging
                    to the audience, and how to have fun with it. Through the discussion, I learned the theories and
                    historical backgrounds behind a music piece.
                    <br><br>
                    Both Corwin and I felt very fortunate to have Warner as our teacher.”
                    - Caisy
                    <br><br><br>
                    “Warner has a warm, supportive way of working with kids that honors them as individuals and helps
                    them grow as musicians. He uses creative activities and fun games to engage his students, and makes
                    learning music fun.”
                    - Tucker
                    <br><br><br>
                    “Mr Warner is very good at incorporating games into guitar class. He helped me to get better at
                    guitar.”

                    <br><br>
                    Recently, Dr. Iveris
                    worked in close collaboration with Berlin-based composer Ruth Wiesenfeld to develop and then perform
